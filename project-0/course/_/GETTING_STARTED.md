# 🚀 Getting Started with Solid.js Signals Course

Welcome to the most comprehensive course on building reactive systems based on Solid.js!

## 📋 What You'll Learn

This course teaches you to build a production-ready reactive library from scratch, understanding every detail of how Solid.js implements fine-grained reactivity.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

### Required

## 📚 Course Structure

### 11 Progressive Units

1. **Foundations** - What is reactivity?
2. **Core Primitives** - Signals, Effects, Memos
3. **Advanced Patterns** - State machines, Selectors
4. **Scheduling** - Task queues, Batching
5. **Transitions** - Concurrent rendering
6. **Arrays** - Efficient list rendering
7. **Resources** - Async data management
8. **Context** - State sharing
9. **Observables** - RxJS integration
10. **Optimization** - Production patterns
11. **Final Project** - Complete library

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Option 1: Linear Path (Recommended for Beginners)

Start with Unit 1 and progress sequentially:

```bash
# Read in order
course/unit-01-foundations/README.md
course/unit-01-foundations/lessons/lesson-01-introduction-to-reactivity.md
# ... complete all lessons and exercises
course/unit-02-core-primitives/README.md
# ... continue through all units
```

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks at 8-12 hours/week

### Option 2: Intensive Path (Experienced Developers)

Focus on implementation:

Week 1:
- Units 1-2: Foundation and core primitives
- Complete basic signal implementation

Week 2:
- Units 3-6: Advanced patterns through arrays
- Build scheduling and reconciliation

Week 3:
- Units 7-10: Resources through optimization
- Complete all primitives

Week 4:
- Unit 11: Final project
- Publish your library

**Timeline**: 4 weeks full-time

### Option 3: Reference Path (Already Know Reactivity)

Jump to specific topics:

- **Just Signals**: Unit 2, Lessons 1-2
- **Just Scheduling**: Unit 4
- **Just Transitions**: Unit 5
- **Just Arrays**: Unit 6
- **Full Implementation**: Unit 11
