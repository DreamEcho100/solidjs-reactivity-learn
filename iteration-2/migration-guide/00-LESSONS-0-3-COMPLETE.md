## 🎓 Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundation (Lessons 0-3)
**Time Required**: 8-10 hours

- **Day 1-2**: Read and understand (4 hours)
  - Overview and architecture
  - Take notes, draw diagrams
  - Compare with your current code

- **Day 3-4**: Type system (3 hours)
  - Set up TypeScript
  - Define all types
  - Test type inference

- **Day 5-7**: Ownership implementation (3-4 hours)
  - Implement createRoot
  - Add cleanup logic
  - Write tests

**Goals**:
- ✅ Understand why Solid.js makes architectural choices
- ✅ Have complete type definitions
- ✅ Working ownership model with tests
- ✅ No memory leaks in basic scenarios

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Students completing lessons 0-3 should be able to:

- [ ] Explain why Solid.js uses a unified Computation type
- [ ] Describe how ownership prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Understand bidirectional tracking advantages

- **Lesson 11**: Advanced features
- **Lesson 12**: Testing migration

## 📝 Notes for Instructors

### Teaching Tips

1. **Don't Rush Foundation**: Lessons 0-3 are critical. Students who understand these will breeze through later lessons.

2. **Encourage Experimentation**: Have students modify examples and see what breaks.

3. **Use Debugging Tools**: The debugging utilities in lesson 3 are invaluable for understanding.

4. **Compare Constantly**: Always show "before vs after" with their current implementation.

5. **Test Early, Test Often**: Each concept should have working tests before moving on.

### Common Struggles

1. **Ownership Concept**: Some find it abstract. Use DOM tree analogy.
2. **Type Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually.
3. **Cleanup Order**: Use visual diagrams to show cascade.
4. **UNOWNED Optimization**: Explain memory benefits clearly.

### Assessment Ideas

- Have students implement a component with nested effects
- Ask them to debug a memory leak scenario
- Request explanation of why certain design choices were made
- Code review: identify ownership issues in sample code

## 🎯 Success Indicators

Students have mastered lessons 0-3 if they can:

1. Build a reactive system with ownership from scratch
2. Explain architecture decisions to others
3. Debug memory leaks using ownership tree
4. Write type-safe reactive code
5. Implement cleanup correctly every time
